1. You will need to initialize the first string it will take in the char form and set them to take for example 100 charaters.
2. You will need to set the length of the strings broken up into substrings after whitespaces.
3. Once you have intilialized variable that can be used later on down the line in for loops you can start taking input from the user.
4. With the first for loop you must look through the string as long as, lets say i is less than or equal to the length of the string.
5. You will need an if statement here to see if there is a whitespace between the string, assign it to the new string that will be created.
6. Then make sure you keep going through the for loop.
7. With an else statement you can assign each substring sepearted by whitespace into the new string.
8. You will then print out each string sepearted by a new line each time it loops through with a new for loop.

It will take up to 100 characters.
It returns the different substrings in the string that are sepearted by the whitspaces.
You will need only two functions in this program, an int main() and an int split_string() or whatever you might want to call it.
int main will have all the printing jobs to do and the int get_string will have to get all the substrings out of the string that are seprated by whitespaces.
